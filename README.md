My Reads is an app that I am making from enrolling in [Udacity's React Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) that manages your books. Books that you **are reading**, **want to read** and **have read**. You may also search for certain books and add them to your lists.
